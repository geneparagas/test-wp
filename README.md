# Restaurant-app

Build a simple webapp that allows the user to filter for restaurants open by date time as well as restaurant name. On top of that, users can save restaurants into their own named collections (eg. Vegetarian favourites, Meat-lovers etc.). Users can also invite their friends to collaborate (add, remove, edit name) on the collections via email, and they can see updates to their collections in real-time, without page refreshes.
